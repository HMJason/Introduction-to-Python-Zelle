Exercise 2.11
Write an interactive Python calculator program. The program should allow the user to type a mathematical expression, 
and then print the value of the expression. Include a loop so that the user can perform many calculations (say, up to 100). 
Note: to quit early, the user can make the program crash by typing a bad expression or simply closing the window that the calculator program is running in. 
Youâ€™ll learn better ways of terminating interactive programs in later chapters.
